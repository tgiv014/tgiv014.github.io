Hi, I'm Thomas Gorham. I graduated with a bachelor's degree in Electrical Engineering (Comm. Systems and Design Specialization) from Kansas State in 2018. Since then, I've been an Electronics Design Engineer for the Marine Radar team at Garmin. I've worked on everything from high-accuracy GPS receivers to low-power human interface devices to FPGA-powered radars. Before that, I served as a Software Engineer intern in their Aviation and Marine segments.

My design experience falls primarily in the digital electronics domain with some basic RF design as well. I have experience writing VHDL and Verilog for signal processing and digital interfacing applications in the Xilinx Zynq ecosystem. I also love to use my software background to pitch in on low-level integration and linux kernel work.

I'm very comfortable writing C, Python, Verilog, and VHDL. I'm very familiar with CAD, both eletrical and mechanical. I'm currently trying to build up some comfort and experience using rust.

At home, I love working with open source hardware, 3d printing, and embedded software. My current obsession is rebuilding my home server setup from the ground up starting with a debian install on a secondhand Dell R710.
