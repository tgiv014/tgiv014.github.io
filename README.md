# tgiv014.github.io
This is my jekyll-generated personal blog. It uses Github's Pages feature to automatically build from source on pushes and host the static site.

# Rendering Locally
It's very convenient to see a fully rendered copy of the site locally when writing. To do serve a local version, use the command:

`bundle exec jekyll serve`

To serve it to other devices on the same network (useful for testing on mobile devices), use:

`bundle exec jekyll serve --host 0.0.0.0`
