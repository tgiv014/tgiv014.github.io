*Short and Sweet*


I want to set some intentions for this site:

## 📋 Document my Work
I cannot count how many times I've forgotten a shell command and had to grep my bash history for it. With some real documentation in place, I can make my home lab easier to maintain.

## ⚙️ Gain Speed
By forcing myself to write about my projects, I hope to build up the momentum to finish them.

## 🖋️ Just Write
It's been a long time since I've done any personal writing. It's time to get back into the habit.
