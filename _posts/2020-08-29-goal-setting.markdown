I need to take a more mindful approach to my personal projects. I tend to get excited about starting new tasks or playing with a new piece of hardware or software, leaving my other projects unfinished or at best undocumented. While it satisfies the urge to try new things, it short-circuits the potential benefit of carrying projects all the way to their completion. This blog is primarily an attempt to encourage myself to think mindfully about how I spend my time on these projects.

With that in mind, I'm laying out a few goals that I want to achieve with this:

## Document my Work
I cannot even begin to count the number of times I've forgotten a shell command and had to grep my bash history for the lost command. With some real documentation in place, I can make my home lab easier to maintain and prevent this situation.

## Encourage Followthrough
By forcing myself to write about my projects, I hope to build up more momentum to finish them.

## Do Some Writing
It's been a long time since I've done any serious writing (outside of pure documentation). This should be a great opportunity to get back into the habit and become a better engineer at the same time.
